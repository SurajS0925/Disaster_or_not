# Disaster_or_not
This project aimed to predict whether tweets describe real disasters using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset included tweet text, along with associated keywords and locations. Initial data exploration provided insights into tweet lengths, common keywords, and the distribution of disaster versus non-disaster tweets, enhanced through visualizations such as histograms and bar plots.

Data preprocessing steps addressed missing values and encoded categorical variables. A Random Forest Classifier was then trained on the processed data, achieving a robust 91% accuracy on the training set. This model was used to generate predictions for a separate test dataset, and the results were formatted into a submission file for evaluation.

Overall, the project involved comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing including categorical encoding, model training with a Random Forest Classifier, prediction generation, and submission file creation. These efforts effectively demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and classify disaster-related content from Twitter feeds.
